    "The task of the project is to classify tweets from Twitter, namely, it is necessary to create a model that will help determine whether a particular tweet belongs to such a type of speech as hate speech. Hate Speech, in simple terms, is offensive language directed at individuals or groups based on their affiliation, interests, and characteristics, such as their religion, nationality, race, color, origin, gender, or other identity factor.\n",

    "The task is quite difficult because of the inherent complexity of natural language constructs - different forms of hatred, different types of goals, different ways of representing the same meaning.\n"
