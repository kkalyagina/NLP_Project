# NLP_Project

## Problem description:
The task of the project is to classify tweets from Twitter, namely, it is necessary to
create a model that will help determine whether a particular tweet belongs to such a
type of speech as hate speech. Hate Speech, in simple terms, is offensive language
directed at individuals or groups based on their affiliation, interests, and
characteristics, such as their religion, nationality, race, color, origin, gender, or other
identity factor.

The task is quite difficult because of the inherent complexity of natural language
constructs - different forms of hatred, different types of goals, different ways of
representing the same meaning.

## Result of Keras Model:
The result shows the likelihood of users' tweet being related to hate speech.
